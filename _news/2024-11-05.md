AI Origo's Director of AI, Konrad Kiss, delivered a comprehensive workshop at [HTE Infokom 2024](https://www.hte.hu/fooldal/-/esemeny/4924988/hte-infokom-2024), Hungary's prestigious telecommunications and computing conference. The workshop was held behind closed doors for a limited audience. Made possible through the initiative of Gyula Solymos, the workshop showcased cutting-edge applications of collaborative AI systems across multiple domains.

The session focused on three key areas where AI is transforming traditional approaches:

## Collaborative AI Research

The workshop demonstrated how multiple AI agents can work together to conduct focused research on specific topics, showing significant improvements in both speed and depth of analysis compared to traditional methods. This collaborative approach enables more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of complex subjects.

## Future of Personalized Education

A significant portion of the workshop explored how AI is revolutionizing education through customization. Kiss presented how AI systems can adapt to individual learning styles and needs, creating truly personalized educational experiences that could transform how we approach learning at all levels.

## Practical AI Integrations

The session included several real-world applications, from personal AI assistants to a detailed case study of legacy code maintenance. These examples illustrated how AI integration can solve practical challenges while improving efficiency and reducing costs.

"We're grateful to Gyula Solymos for initiating this workshop," said Kiss. "It provided an excellent opportunity to share how collaborative AI systems are reshaping various industries and creating new possibilities for research, education, and system maintenance."

The presentation at HTE Infokom 2024 aligns with AI Origo's mission to pioneer practical applications of AI technology across different sectors. The enthusiastic response from attendees demonstrated the growing interest in collaborative AI solutions among telecommunications and IT professionals.
